The 'ScaleishBritian' isn't actually quite to scale. This means things might be quite a few kilometres out, though
no one should notice when playing at this stage. The problem is getting the heightmap image to map onto the pixelmapUK.
Currently the 'solution' is just doing it roughly and hoping no one will notice the latitudes and longitudes are a bit out.
